# cargo-deny configuration for teehistorian-py
# This file configures cargo-deny to check for security vulnerabilities,
# license compliance, and other issues in dependencies.

[graph]
# If 1 or more target triples (and optionally, target_features) are specified,
# only the specified targets will be checked when running `cargo deny check`.
# This means, if a particular package is only ever used as a target specific
# dependency, such as, for example, `winapi` or `nix`, a specifier `windows`
# or `unix` can be used instead of a full target triple.

# ]
# When creating the dependency graph used as the source of truth when checks are
# executed, this field can be used to prune crates from the graph, removing them
# from all checks. This is an extremely heavy hammer, and should only be used if
# you know exactly what you're doing.

# be toggled off if true, if you want to conditionally enable it, use `--all-features`

[output]
# When outputting inclusion graphs in diagnostics that include features, this
# option can be used to specify the depth at which feature edges will be added.
# This option is included since the graphs can be quite large and the addition
# of features from the crate(s) to all of the graph roots can be far too verbose.
# This option can be overridden via `--feature-depth` on the cmd line
